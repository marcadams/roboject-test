roboject-test
=============

This demonstrates the use of Android and Roboject to handle view/layout/resource injection.

To run:

* Clone this repository
* Open up terminal/command prompt
* `mvn clean install`
* `mvn android:run` with an Android device connected via USB or an AVD running.

Very simple but demonstrates the core power of the Roboject library.
